# ScrapeDiscord
Scrape messages from discord channel

This particular implementation uses the discord channel as a database where the user saves his daily weight. 
Running this code will give him an average rate of change of his weight over time, as well as a graph to view the data.

Makes it easier to keep a daily record, requiring only the phone in the bathroom to keep the data available in any computer, without additional software.
